Thesis: Heterogenous risk preferences and risk trading for energy communities providing ancillary services

The model can be run through the file "Model Files\out_of_sample.jl" or through "Model Files\main.jl". 
The different risk models can be run in the two .jl files by changing the string risktype. Options are "CC","JCC","HJCC" and "CVaR".
Both folders "Model Files" and "Input Data" must be downloaded to run the model.
